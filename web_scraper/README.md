## Installation

**Run**
`pip3 install selenium`

## Use

**Run (use python 3)**
`python3 metadata_scraper.py`

**Then Run (tested this in python 2, sorry!)**
`python downloader.py`

*Metadata_scraper.py* should open a programatically controlled browser and use it to get all the unique election ids and download metadata about each election.

*downloader.py* should use the .txt file containing election ids generated by the metadatascraper.py to download every csv. I got a connection refused error after running this for a while. Perhapse do it slower or run from multiple ip addresses? Maybe it's a spicific file fouling up? If so add an exception and keep going.
